# swyw
**S**tore **W**hat **Y**ou **W**ant is a simple tool I made for my students who needed an API their front-end project. The objective of this API is to allow them to store any data, in any format so they can expirement ajax calls while developping a Vuejs project.

With Swyw, each student have access to his own dictionary (/{userName}) where he can GET|POST|PUT|DELETE his own data, aka entities (/{userName}/{entityName}).

Swyw is ready to run and has a swagger, launch it and give it a try ;)
